# GoodLuck Restaurants
## Description
Very interactive restaurant script that allows you to set as many cooking locations as you want around the island and limit those locations to a specific whitelisted job. Depending on if you fail some skill checks, management of the temperature and cook time you will receive lower quality/grade of food and if you fail enough you will receive ruined food (or whatever you want to set it to). There is also benefits to a person cooking in bulks but doing so is also more risky due to possibility of wasting more ingredients on lower quality food.
## How it Works

### Cooking Food
1. Picking a recipe by doing /recipebook <pagenumber> (Ex. /recipebook 1)
    - This shows all the available recipes for the given job you are employed with
    - This the recipes are set in the config per whitelisted job

2. Pick the amount of the food you want to cook
    - Cooking in bulk can reward extra of the food per 5 cooked and skill checks hit during cooking

3. Set the initial cooking temperature
    - This temperature will fluctuate depending on if you fail the skill checks while cooking so it is recommended to set it somewhere in the middle
