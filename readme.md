## How it Works
- Cooking Food
- Mixing Drinks
### Cooking Food
1. Picking a recipe by doing /recipebook <pagenumber> (Ex. /recipebook 1)
    - This shows all the available recipes for the given job you are employed with
    - This the recipes are set in the config per whitelisted job

2. Pick the amount of the food you want to cook
    - Cooking in bulk can reward extra of the food per 5 cooked and skill checks hit during cooking
